# Project: Todo List

At this point, youâ€™ve already had a fair amount of practice using various techniques. Before we move on, let's slow down and focus on a great portfolio project: **The Todo List**. Todo lists are a staple in beginning web development tutorials. While the implementation can be basic, there's plenty of room for improvement and many features that can be added.



### Brainstorming
- Your 'todos' will be dynamic objects. Consider using factories or constructors/classes for generation.
- Think about properties for your todo-items: at a minimum, they should include a title, description, dueDate, and priority. Optionally, include notes or even a checklist.

### Project Organization
- Implement projects or separate lists of todos.
- On initial app load, provide a 'default' project for todos.
- Allow users to create new projects and assign todos to them.

### Application Logic and Structure
- Separate application logic (creating and modifying todos) from the DOM-related code. Use separate modules for a cleaner structure.

### User Interface
Your UI should allow users to:
- View all projects.
- View all todos in each project (at least the title and due date; consider color-coding for different priorities).
- Expand a single todo to see/edit its details.
- Delete a todo.
