# Advanced Todo List

Welcome to the repository of my advanced Todo List application. This project is a demonstration of practical web development techniques using the Module Pattern and Webpack for bundling. The application is fully functional, allowing users to manage their tasks effectively with a variety of features.

## Features

- **Dynamic Todo Creation**: Users can dynamically create todo items using object-oriented JavaScript (utilizing the Module Pattern).
- **Edit and Delete**: Each todo can be edited or deleted as needed.
- **Due Dates**: Set and view due dates for tasks to manage time effectively.
- **Project Organization**: Users can create projects to categorize and manage todos.
- **Persistence**: Using the Web Storage API, the todos and projects persist across sessions.

## Demo

## Technical Aspects

- **Module Pattern**: The application logic is encapsulated using the Module Pattern, promoting maintainability and reusability.
- **Webpack**: Utilized Webpack for bundling modules, optimizing loading time and improving overall performance.
- **Local Storage**: Implemented local storage to ensure user data is saved and available on subsequent visits.

## User Interface

The application boasts a user-friendly interface allowing for easy management of tasks:

- **View Projects**: Users can view all their projects and respective tasks.
- **Manage Todos**: Within each project, users can add, edit, or delete todos, as well as expand them to view/edit detailed information like descriptions, due dates, and priorities.
- **Color-Coded Priorities**: Todos can be color-coded based on priority, making it easy to identify the most critical tasks at a glance.
